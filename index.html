          <p>
            <b> Albert Einstein</b> 1879-1955
            Albert Einstein German-born physicist who developed the special and general theories of relativity and won the Nobel Prize
             for Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Einstein is generally considered the most influential
              physicist of the 20th century.All our thoughts and concepts are called up by sense-experiences and have a meaning only in
               reference to these sense-experiences. On the other hand, however, they are products of the spontaneous activity of our minds; 
               they are thus in no wise logical consequences of the contents of these sense-experiences. If, therefore, we wish to grasp the 
               essence of a complex of abstract notions we must for the one part investigate the mutual relationships between the concepts and
                the assertions made about them; for the other, we must investigate how they are related to the experiences.
